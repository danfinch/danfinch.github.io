our many retail locations. This was primarily used to look up products when a customer brought
in a return. It was difficult to use as we had about 5 or so different types of SKUs for each
product. Some were not supported by the tool and those that were had to be entered just right.</p>
<p>The existing tool was written in ASP.NET 1.0 about 10 years prior and it was not possible to
bring it into a newer framework. To avoid working with the spaghettified nightmare of Web Forms
I spent about an hour writing a reflection-based MVC engine which lived inside a .ashx handler
file. I created a more modern UI and made sure the SQL query was flexible enough to find any
product by any of its SKUs.</p>
<p>This took about a day and a half, it was released, and I heard nothing more about it. About
a month later my manager came over to my desk and said &quot;you got a minute? come with me&quot;. I
followed him downstairs to a conference room filled with about 200 people and we walked to
the front. He said &quot;this is Dan, he rewrote the product lookup tool&quot;. The crowd erupted into
applause and cheering. It turned out to be a meeting of our retail location managers and
apparently I had eliminated one of their biggest headaches!</p>
