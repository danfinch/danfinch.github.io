AJAX was very popular but
the tools to fill the gap between dynamic and static sites were not yet around. Server side
rendering was necessary, but I still wanted to provide very interactive pages without adding
a completely different client-side framework for rendering markup.</p>
<p>I settled on what some called AHAH - Asynchronous HTML And HTTP - where the server rendered
partial views via XMLHttpRequests which were inserted into the DOM. I made use of a number
of non-standard HTML attributes to declaratively wire up these insertions. As a result very
few widgets needed custom code. jQuery was patched at startup to rebind events when content
was inserted. I was able to achieve performant and flashy interactions with careful use of
jQuery (it is possible!) long before they became commonplace.</p>
<p>Working with views in ASP.NET prior to the release of Razor was painful: unmaintainable soup
markup was everywhere. As a result, many people were creating their own view engines. I did
not have the bandwidth to create and maintain a custom view engine, let alone make it work
with the IDE. </p>
<p>I decided to create a C#-based fluent DSL and write the views directly in the host language
itself. People now call this hyperscript, and it is fairly common, but at the time (2008-ish),
other programmers thought I was insane! This had many benefits - I did not have two syntaxes
mixed up in the same file, I had all the support of my IDE (autocomplete, type checking), and
I could package components as DLL files. Layout views could simply be written as methods with
parameters for the &quot;holes&quot;.</p>
<p>In debug mode my view engine would set up a file watcher and auto-reload views as I worked on
them; another perk which was scoffed at then but is now looked at as a standard feature of a web
stack.</p>
