AJAX was very popular but the tools to fill the gap between dynamic and static sites were not yet around. Server side rendering was necessary, but I still wanted to provide very interactive pages without adding a completely different client-side framework for rendering markup.</p><p>I settled on what some called AHAH - Asynchronous HTML And HTTP - where the server rendered partial views via XMLHttpRequests which were inserted into the DOM. I made use of a number of non-standard HTML attributes to declaratively wire up these insertions. As a result very few widgets needed custom code. jQuery was patched at startup to rebind events when content was inserted. I was able to achieve performant and flashy interactions with careful use of jQuery (it is possible!) long before they became commonplace.</p><p>Working with views in ASP.NET prior to the release of Razor was painful: unmaintainable soup markup was everywhere. As a result, many people were creating their own view engines. I did not have the bandwidth to create and maintain a custom view engine, let alone make it work with the IDE.</p><p>I decided to create a C#-based fluent DSL and write the views directly in the host language itself. People now call this hyperscript, and it is fairly common, but at the time (2008-ish), other programmers thought I was insane! This had many benefits - I did not have two syntaxes mixed up in the same file, I had all the support of my IDE (autocomplete, type checking), and I could package components as DLL files. Layout views could simply be written as methods with parameters for the “holes”.</p><p>In debug mode my view engine would set up a file watcher and auto-reload views as I worked on them; another perk which was scoffed at then but is now looked at as a standard feature of a web stack.</p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 15, 2021</p></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danfinch/" aria-label="LinkedIn" class="linkedin"><svg><use xlink:href="https://da.nfin.ch/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii and Github Pages</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
