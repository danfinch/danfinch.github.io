AJAX was very popular but the tools to fill the gap between dynamic and static sites were not yet around. Server side rendering was necessary, but I still wanted to provide very interactive pages without adding a completely different client-side framework for rendering markup.</p><p>I settled on what some called AHAH - Asynchronous HTML And HTTP - where the server rendered partial views via XMLHttpRequests which were inserted into the DOM. I made use of a number of non-standard HTML attributes to declaratively wire up these insertions. As a result very few widgets needed custom code. jQuery was patched at startup to rebind events when content was inserted. I was able to achieve performant and flashy interactions with careful use of jQuery (it is possible!) long before they became commonplace.</p><p>Working with views in ASP.NET prior to the release of Razor was painful: unmaintainable soup markup was everywhere. As a result, many people were creating their own view engines. I did not have the bandwidth to create and maintain a custom view engine, let alone make it work with the IDE.</p><p>I decided to create a C#-based fluent DSL and write the views directly in the host language itself. People now call this hyperscript, and it is fairly common, but at the time (2008-ish), other programmers thought I was insane! This had many benefits - I did not have two syntaxes mixed up in the same file, I had all the support of my IDE (autocomplete, type checking), and I could package components as DLL files. Layout views could simply be written as methods with parameters for the “holes”.</p><p>In debug mode my view engine would set up a file watcher and auto-reload views as I worked on them; another perk which was scoffed at then but is now looked at as a standard feature of a web stack.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://da.nfin.ch/media/website/pfp.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Dan"><div><h3><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/authors/dan/" class="invert" rel="author">Dan</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/" title="About Me" target="_self">About</a></li><li><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/experience/" target="_self">Experience</a></li><li><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/tech/" target="_self">Tech</a></li><li class="active-parent has-submenu"><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/tags/stories/" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Stories</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/coldwater-creek-product-catalog/" target="_self">Product Catalog</a></li><li><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/a-standing-ovation/" target="_self">Standing Ovation</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/pre-modern-hyperscript/" target="_self">Hyperscript</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://da.nfin.ch/contact/" target="_self">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 Theme - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Publii</a></p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://da.nfin.ch/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://da.nfin.ch/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://da.nfin.ch/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://da.nfin.ch/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://da.nfin.ch/assets/js/main.min.js?v=448f4c9d4b4c374766a1cb76c3d88048"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
